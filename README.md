### Robin - MS2: Everyone should try to commit to GitHub. The project needs to be compiled.

### Robin - MS3: Everyone should try to commit to GitHub. Where is the combined project code? Did you make 4 function specifications? Where is the blackbox test code? The Jira Board can be updated with more content.

### Robin - MS4: Everyone should implement the hooks. Does the project compile? I didn't see any .sln or cmake or project file.  @Prabhjot: what does test_command="./test_suite" execute?
