The test functions are testing the interaction and integration of various functions and components 
from the finder.h module, such as routes, shipments, trucks, and maps.

Integration tests typically involve multiple units of code working together to achieve a specific 
functionality, and they are used to validate that these units collaborate effectively. 
Your test functions exhibit this behavior:

    test_findValidTruckPaths(): Tests the interaction between the findValidTruckPaths() function, 
    the mock map, and the predefined routes.

    test_hasDestination(): Tests the interaction between the hasDestination() function and predefined 
    routes and shipments.

    test_isBuildingIntersected(): Tests the interaction between the isBuildingIntersected() function, 
    the predefined map, and routes.

    test_getBestRoute(): Tests the interaction between the getBestRoute() function, predefined routes, 
    and shipments.

    test_isTruckOverloaded(), test_isBoxSizeExceeded(), test_validCargo(): Test interactions between various 
    functions related to truck and cargo handling.

Each of these tests exercises the interaction between different components and checks whether they work correctly 
together to achieve the desired functionality. This aligns with the concept of integration testing. Keep in mind that 
integration tests can cover a range of scenarios where multiple units of code need to collaborate effectively.
