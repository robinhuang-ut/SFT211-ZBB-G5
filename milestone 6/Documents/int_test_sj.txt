It tests the collaboration between the different components (functions) by simulating their usage 
in a real-world scenario.

In this test suite:

    findValidTruckPaths, getBestRoute, isTruckOverloaded, isBoxSizeExceeded, and validCargo functions
    are all being called together to test their interactions and outputs.

    The test suite sets up the necessary initial data structures (map, shipment, truck) with appropriate
    values to represent a real-world scenario.

    It then calls the functions using these data structures, simulating how they would work together in an
     actual system.

    The outputs of the functions are printed to the console, allowing you to manually inspect the results and
     verify that the interactions and collaborations are functioning as expected.
