    Interaction between Components: Each test case involves testing the interaction and collaboration between
     different functions and data structures. For example, you are testing how shipments interact with trucks, 
     how routes are calculated and compared, and how cargo constraints are validated within a specific context.

    Collaboration of Modules: The tests cover scenarios where multiple functions from the finder.h module need 
    to collaborate to achieve a specific functionality, such as determining the best route, checking cargo 
    constraints, and handling shipments and trucks.

    Testing System Behavior: Integration tests aim to ensure that the entire system behaves correctly 
    when its components are combined. Your test cases check if the composed behavior of various functions 
    and structures meets the expected criteria.

    Scenario-Based Testing: The test cases cover various scenarios and combinations of inputs that are 
    relevant to your application's functionality. This approach is common in integration testing, where you 
    test how the components interact in different use cases.

    Validation of Business Logic: The tests focus on validating the correctness of business 
    logic and system behavior, rather than isolating individual units of code.

    Output Validation: Each test case checks the final output or behavior of a specific scenario, 
    which is typical in integration testing.
